<h2>Programming Experience</h2>
I began learning to code with the South Bend Code School in 2017, in sixth grade. During the school year
2017-2018, I coded a few projects including a website dedicated to encouraging people to adopt dogs from
local animal shelters called B. A. R. K. This I coded along with a group of my fellow students in the South
Bend Code School. I also created a video game using Javascript and a friendogram. This year, I have coded two
 projects, described below.

<h2>My Projects</h2>
I have created two main projects. The first is a video game based on the Battle of Cannae. The Battle of Cannae
was a battle fought during the Second Punic War between Carthage and Rome during the Carthiginian invasion
of Italy. The battle was a devestating defeat for the Romans and nearly caused them to lose the war. The second
project, which I created in cooperation with two others, is dedicated to raising awareness about Climate
Change.
