It is the year 216 B.C.E. You are the Carthiginian General Hannibal in command
of 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. In recent ears you have been invading
Italy,meeting with some success. However, the Romans' Fabian strategy has
prevented any decisisve battle. Now, however, Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius
 Terentius Varro, two Roman consuls, are bringing 74,000 infantry and 6,000
 cavalry to attack you around the village of Cannae. However, arriving at the
 battlefield first, you may choose whether you wish to fight in the gap between
 the highland and the river, or in the plain.
