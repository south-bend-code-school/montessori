        <h2>We believe that everyone is created equal and nobody deserves to be homeless and living on the streets. Our goal is to help homeless people by giving them a place to stay and a job until they are well enough to live on there own.</h2>

        <h3>Hi! Our names are Mason (right), Makiah (middle), and Cooper (left) and we created this website! We live in the South Bend, Indiana area and we realized that there are a lot of people that are homeless in our area. While our homeless shelter in this area, we feel that it could be better. And the truth is, it's not just our little city of South Bend that has this problem. Just recently in the January of 2019, there have been over 552,000 people that have been homeless in the U.S., and thats just in America. In the whole world, the current population of homeless is over 150 million,and a little bit more than 1.6 billion have bad hosing. Our hope is to start our cause locally, giving hope to the people that don't have homes. If we do well, we hope to expand awareness of this problem globally, so that no one has to go through what some are going through right now. We hope that you feel that the things that these homeless people have to go through every day should never be experienced. So help make the world a little better and spread awareness, donate, or help someone in need. No one deserves to be homeless.</h3>
