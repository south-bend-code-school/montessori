<h1>In the Supermarket</h1>

<div>
<p>Food is one of the basic necessities of human life, and with the increase of the human population over
time, with a population of 10,000,000,000 projected for 2050, the demand for food constantly increases over
time. However, rather than an increase in argricultural productivity to meet this ever-increasing need,
agricultural productivity is decreasing as a result of global warming, robbing supermarkets of many of
goods which once resided on their shelves, available for purchase, for a number of reasons. Firstly,
Climate Change is causing increased acidity and salinity in water, which will create difficulties in crop
irrigation, which could reduce vegetable and legume production by as much as 35% by 2100. By 2100,
corn yields, the mian source of food for livestock, could be reduced even more dramatically, by 50%,
immeasurably harming meat production. In addition, formerly predictable rainfall patterns are severely
disrupted by Climate Change, leading to both droughts and toxin-bringing floods, both severely damaging crops.
In addition to causing problems, Climate Change also intensifies already existing ones, such as the very
problematic problem of groundwater depletion, especially in major agricultural areas. Extreme weather can
also hinder food transportation or cause spoilage, leading to food poisoning or famine.
<br>
As for the effects of increased temperatures, they are surprisingly both positive and negative, though,
naturally,mostly negative. The range of some products, such as potatoes, will in fact be extended, though
the range of many crops will also be decreased, and both of these effects will severely disrupt agriculture.
In addition, not only the ranges of crops will be extended, but also the range of potentially famine-causing
virus and fungi and parasites, such as the wheat rust epidemic that devastated vulnerable, immunity-lacking
crops. Livestock also become more vulnerable to disease because of delibating heat waves, the frequency of
which is greatly increased by Climate Change. Also, the culprit itself, the Carbon Dioxide itself which causes
Climate Change disrupts the internal metabolism of plants and decreases protein levels. As for the fishing
industry, similar to plant ranges, Climate Change severely disrupts the ranges of commonly fished seafood, which
not only causes logistical problems for fishermen and seafood shortages for consumers, it also causes
some fish to move into the former habitats of others, causing newfound competition which only worsens
the problem. The heating of the seas also disturbs fish metabolisms, causing their mercury content to increase,
which is especially problematic as this is highly poisonous. In addition to this, the microbes which
compromise the unseen foundation of the great marine ecosystem, like the masses of laborers who form
the basis of any economy, are severely affected by the increased acidity of the oceans. Finally, rising sea
levels can damage coastal aquaculture of salt-intolerant fish.
