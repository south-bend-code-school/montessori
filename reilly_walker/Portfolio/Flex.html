<h1>My name is Reilly, and this is a website's purpose is to depict my coding experience. It will also reveal my dependability. I am a guitar player and look forward to playing in a band. I have been coding for almost a year, and find it to be quite confusing at times. However, I am determined to get through it. One of my favorite activities is walking my dog, Holly. She is a basset hound and is 3 years old.</h1>

<h1>I have been coding for 6 months now and enjoy the feeling of completing a project. My friends and I have made a website that has working links to merch/donations. This website is devoted to helping animals and getting them get back into the wild, on the homepage, it has a link to animals we have possession of and (if you want to) you could adopt and help the animals too. Another website I have also made animations and used a website called p5.js to make geometricle shapes dance. I have also made a burger that can have any topping as long as said topping is typed into the code. Along with these projects, I have made a logo, an animation when hovering over a certain shape.</h1>
